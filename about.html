        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm Ahmed Azhary, a cybersecurity leader with over a decade of hands‑on
          experience defending banks, telecom operators and global enterprises.  As
          the Head of SOC at NBK Egypt, I architected and ran regional security
          operations centres across multiple countries, aligning strategy with
          business objectives and regulation.  My passion lies in building
          high‑performing teams and delivering resilient security at scale.

      <h2>Experience</h2>

        Throughout my career I have led incident response programmes, threat
        hunting and defence initiatives for banking, telecom and Fortune 500
        organisations.  As a senior leader I combine strategic vision with
        deep technical expertise to deliver transformative security
        outcomes.  I have built world‑class SOC teams, unified complex
        security platforms and reduced response times through automation.

        cyber resilience.  My work is backed by 10+ years of experience
        covering network security, incident management, governance and
        compliance.
